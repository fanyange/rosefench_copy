This is my first Rails practicing project.

Although it is just a "Pixel level copy" -- no test, no many dynamic pages and no any innovations, I know, ["The first step is to start"](http://signalvnoise.com/posts/2538-the-first-step-is-to-start). I can begin from nothing, adding fantastic features step by step, iteratively refactoring, then at some point, change the world we live, even slightly.

Best wished to myself.
